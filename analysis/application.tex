\section{NTP client application}
Apart from the time interface, the NTP client application
also needs to use the operating system network interface.
Thanks to the uIP stack, described in section~\ref{sec:contiki-uip},
the network communication is not a matter for Contiki OS.

The NTP client needs server associations in the NTP unicast communication mode.
However, too many server associations complicate the client design.
In fact, in the most common scenario, there can be only a single NTP master server
for the whole network.
A single server association requires just a simple calculation of the local clock offset
$\theta$, whereas more server associations require the intersection algorithm
described in section~\ref{sec:ntp-algorithms}.
Implementation of such an algorithm, requiring advanced data structures, should be avoided
in a memory constrained system.

The NTP broadcast communication mode, on the other hand,
requires no server associations and no packet filling process on the client side.
Moreover, because the client does not have to actively send any NTP packets,
an energy consumption of the client is reduced.

%DESIGN
%The broadcast mode is intended particularly for energy or memory constrained clients
%or for a huge number of NTP clients and a single NTP server
%in a network with small propagation delays.

% 1 - see design
A problem might be a possible packet loss when communication uses UDP on transport layer.
The reason why this can happen often in Contiki, is explained in section~\ref{sec:contiki-uip}.
% 2
In NTP unicast mode, the packet loss might occur either for a client's query to the server
or for a server's response to the client.
If the client's query loss occurs, no server response will be sent.
Similarly, if the server's response loss occurs, no message will be received by the client.
Not to block a whole system till the response arrives
is therefore a desired behaviour of the client.

The NTP client should be able to communicate over both IPv4 and IPv6.
Thanks to the uIP stack, this is no a matter for Contiki.
The only constraint is that both IP versions can not be used simultaneously
and the decision must be made during the compilation~\cite{contiki-docs}.
Although the {\it{UIP\_CONF\_IPV6}} macro can be used to determine which IP version
support is being compiled, the NTP client application should be written IP-version agnostic.

The NTP client will further calculate the local clock offset using the NTP timestamps
as described in section~\ref{sec:ntp-algorithms}.
As mentioned in section~\ref{sec:ntp-time}, the NTP timescale is not
coincident with the POSIX timescale.
If the new calls in the time interface should use the standard POSIX timescale,
conversion between NTP and POSIX timestamps must be calculated.

The Transmit Timestamp sent by the client can be set to any arbitrary value.
This is in compliance with the NTPv4 specification~\cite{rfc5905}.
It is important for the client to store the sent timestamp,
since it is later used by the client to check the server's response.
That practically means, that the conversion from the POSIX timestamp to the 64-bit long NTP timestamp
is not needed when the client sends the request.
However, the conversion vice versa is needed when the client calculates
the local clock offset from the received timestamps.

Since both timescales reckon in seconds, the conversion from
the NTP timestamp seconds field value and the POSIX timestamp seconds field value is simple.
However, the conversion from the NTP fraction field value ($2^{-32}$)
to the POSIX fraction field value (nanoseconds or microseconds) is problematic.
The relation between the POSIX fraction field and the NTP fraction field
is given by $POSIX.frac = NTP.frac \times POSIX.res \div 2^{32}$,
where $POSIX.frac$ is the POSIX fraction field value,
$NTP.frac$ is the NTP fraction field value and
$POSIX.res$ is the POSIX timestamp resolution (microseconds or nanoseconds).
The accurate conversion requires either floating point operations or operations with 64 bit numbers.
These operations can be memory expensive, especially on 8-bit microcontrollers,
and their usage must be carefully considered or another suitable solution must be designed.


!TO DESIGN!
%design---
Contiki NTP Client fills and checks only the seconds part of the NTP timestamp,
because the timestamp should be as accurate as possible and the
conversion from nanoseconds to NTP fraction part would increase the interval
between determination of the timestamp and dispatch of the packet.
