\chapter{Introduction}
Today we live in a world where embedded systems are part of almost every electronic thing. Modern televisions
contain embedded system to allow you to browse the web, modern cars contain embedded system to give you summary information
about the journey using GPS, even fridge showing the list of things you plan to buy at a market are becoming popular.
Embedded systems are becoming spread more than ever and so does
their need for a network connection.

Contiki is an operating system targeted at embedded systems
developed by Adam Dunkels at Swedish Institute of Computer Science in Kista, Sweden.
Contiki brings new concepts to the embedded world such as Protothreads and features
the Internet Protocol version 6 and 4 support.
Since Contiki aims for maximum protability it is written in C programming language.
Contiki therefore provides an ideal solution for connecting
embedded systems to the existing network on many different platforms.

Time synchronisation is today also important.
Almost every modern system today has a need for an exact time -
your video-recorder or home cinema automatically recording film at specified time, your washing-machine finishing the
desired program when you go back home or your radio automatically adjusting its clock when the time changes
due to daylight saving.

Network Time Protocol (NTP) is ubiquitous protocol for time synchronisation between computers on modern Internet.
Though being one of the oldest protocol, NTP is still developed and updated to conform to the latest
network standards. Actual version at the time of writing is NTP version~4, which updates its previous version to
accommodate the Internet Protocol version~6.

This Bachelor thesis describes Contiki operating system, its concepts and philosophy, time synchronisation protocol
Network Time Protocol version~4 and design and implementation of NTP client for Contiki operating system.
