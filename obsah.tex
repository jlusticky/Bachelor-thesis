\chapter{Introduction}
Today we live in a world where embedded systems are part of almost every electronic device.
Modern television contains embedded systems to allow you to browse web,
modern cars contain embedded systems to give you summary information
about the journey using GPS, even fridge showing the list of things you plan to buy at a market are becoming popular.
Embedded systems are becoming spread more than ever and so does
their need for a network connection.

Contiki is an operating system targeted at embedded systems
developed by Adam Dunkels at Swedish Institute of Computer Science in Kista, Sweden.
Contiki brings new concepts to the embedded world such as Protothreads and features
the Internet Protocol version 6 and 4 support.
Since Contiki aims for maximum portability it is written in C programming language.
Contiki therefore provides an ideal solution for connecting
embedded systems to existing network on many different hardware platforms.

Time synchronisation is also important today.
Almost every modern system has a need for an exact time -
your video-recorder or home cinema automatically recording film at specified time, your washing-machine finishing the
desired program when you go back home or your radio automatically adjusting its clock when the time changes
due to daylight saving.

Network Time Protocol (NTP) is ubiquitous protocol for time synchronisation between computers on modern Internet.
Though being one of the oldest protocol, NTP is still developed and updated to conform to the latest
network standards. Actual version at the time of writing is NTP version~4, which updates its previous version to
accommodate the Internet Protocol version~6.

This thesis describes Contiki operating system, its concepts and philosophy,
Network Time Protocol version~4 and design and implementation of NTP client for Contiki operating system.

\chapter{Conclusion}
The implemented clock interface and NTP client fits to Contiki OS...

Future work:
It is useful to provide an initial volley where the client operating in
client mode exchanges several packets with the server, so as to
calibrate the propagation delay and to run the Autokey security
protocol, after which the client reverts to broadcast client mode~\cite{rfc5905}.

Refid~\cite{rfc5905}?? - not necessary

Ability to communicate with more servers. Requires clock selection algorithms.

Advanced clock discipline algorithms -
The clock discipline process is a system process that controls the
time and frequency of the system clock~\cite{rfc5905},

ntpv4.pdf:
SNTP is intended for primary
servers equipped with a single reference clock, as well as clients with a single upstream server
and no dependent clients.

It is useful to provide an
initial volley where the client operating in mode 3 exchanges several packets with the server in
order to calibrate the propagation delay

The operating system is assumed to provide two functions, one to set the time
directly, for example the Unix settimeofday()1 function, and another to adjust the time in small
increments advancing or retarding the time by a designated amount, for example the Unix
adjtime() function. In the intended design the clock discipline process uses the adjtime() function
if the adjustment is less than a designated threshold, and the settimeofday() function if above the
threshold.

rfc5905:
In the case of NTP as specified herein, NTP broadcast clients are
vulnerable to disruption by misbehaving or hostile SNTP or NTP
broadcast servers elsewhere in the Internet.  Such disruption can be
minimized by several approaches.  Filtering can be employed to limit
the access of NTP clients to known or trusted NTP broadcast servers.
Such filtering will prevent malicious traffic from reaching the NTP
clients.
