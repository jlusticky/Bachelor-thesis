...uvod do packet lost + ref
However, packet loss is not a matter for NTP if using either broadcast or unicast mode.
In broadcast mode, lost server packet causes no setting or adjusting time of client's
local clock.
The client simply waits without disruption for next NTP broadcast message.
If client needs to figure out it's local clock offset at the moment,
it can simply query a server using NTP unicast mode.

... no waiting until packet received
This was implemented using {\it{PROCESS\_YIELD}} statement.

NTP server can be specified in Makefile or
during compilate time using {\it{REMOTE\_HOST}} define.
%! TODO
TODO: If no host is specified,
NTP client assumes NTP broadcast communication mode.

Routing to Meinberg NTP primary server.
Measurements made using this setup are discussed in chapter~\ref{chap:measurements}.
