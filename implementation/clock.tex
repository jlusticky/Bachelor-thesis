\section{Hardware clock interface}
Contiki features a basic clock interface with a simple goal - measuring time.
This interface provides needed calls for timers and its definition is to be found in {\it{/core/sys/clock.h}} file.
Specific implementations of this common interface are located in {\it{/cpu}} directory of Contiki source code.
The interface provides call for initialising CPU's clock system - {\it{clock\_init}}, that is automatically called during
boot sequence of Contiki.
The goal of the {\it{clock\_init}} call is to set up
appropriate counter registers and interrupt service routines. %! TODO .. as described in chapter..
On AVR CPU this call is implemented as C macro which evaluates to specific setup code for each CPU
when compiling.
The setup code is not common to all CPUs because of differences among them - e.g. there are usually
only three Timer/Counter modules, but AVR ATmega1284P has four Timer/Counter modules~\cite{avr-datasheet}.

%At least one of those is always 16 bit wide
%This extra module on AVR ATmega1284P is used for
% three vs. 3

%clock\_seconds
%CLOCK\_SECOND
This is however enough for implementing a reasonable time interface and using it for NTP client later.

% ntp interface extending the clock library, similar to posix calls

%!!AVR

Adjusting time - COMPARE\_REGISTER = 31 => 128Hz => 1s = 1s
FREQ = 32768/8 / 32
COMPARE\_REGISTER = 30 => ca132.129Hz => 1s = ca1.032258s
FREQ = 32768/8 / 31
COMPARE\_REGISTER = 32 => 124.12per => 1s = 0.96p
FREQ = 32768/8 / 33

=> fastest adjust is 0,03s / s


Each TCNT2 increment is $\frac{1}{128 \times 32} \doteq 0,000244$ s
2,44ms minimum clock slew
This is also minimal possible clock adjustment.


Adjustments will influence the timers.
Applications requiring uninfluenced timers
are therefore advised to use rtimers, described in section~\ref{sec:contiki-timers},
because they use separate hardware clock
unaffected by NTP client.
