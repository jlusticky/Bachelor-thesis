\chapter{Design}
Previous chapter showed, that just an implementation of an
NTP client application is due to missing calls in the time interface not sufficient.
The time interface must be extended with new calls,
that must be further implemented in the clock interface.
Figure~\ref{fig:design-overview} shows the NTP client overview.

%How to get a working setup with Contiki on this platform is described in
%the document files on the CD enclosed to this thesis.
%The CD content hierarchy is listed in appendix~\ref{app:cd-content}.

%... This is not in Contiki, as operating systems targeted at embbeded systems produce only 1 binary file. CITATION
