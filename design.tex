\chapter{Design}
Figure~\ref{fig:design-overview} shows the NTP client overview.
Previous chapter showed, that just a simple implementation of the application
is due to missing calls in time interface not sufficient.
The time interface must be extended with new calls,
that must be implemented in the clock interface.

%How to get a working setup with Contiki on this platform is described in
%the document files on the CD enclosed to this thesis.
%The CD content hierarchy is listed in appendix~\ref{app:cd-content}.

%... This is not in Contiki, as operating systems targeted at embbeded systems produce only 1 binary file. CITATION
