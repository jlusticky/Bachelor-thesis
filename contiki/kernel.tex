\section{The kernel}
The kernel in Contiki is event-driven but the system supports preemptive
multi-threading that can be applied on a per-process basis~\cite{video}.
The preemption is not implemented in the kernel, but
preemptive multi-threading is implemented as a library that is linked only with programs that
explicitly require multi-threading~\cite{paper-contiki}.
The kernel itself contains no platform specific code, it implements only CPU multiplexing and
lets device drivers and applications communicate directly with hardware~\cite{video}.
As stated before, Contiki is well documented and you can find out more about
kernel as well as the system in the documentation~\cite{contiki-docs}.
% todo - process
The Contiki kernel does not provide support for timed events~\cite{contiki-docs}.
