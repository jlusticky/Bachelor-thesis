\section{Operating system time interface - TODO}
The main problem of NTP client implementation for Contiki is therefore a total
lack of real-time support.
Not only no common interface is available, but also
almost no platform-specific code has been implemented towards time interface yet.



-- git

Setting the current time is only possible within one second precision -
finer time setting must be made through time adjustments described further.
Implemented {\it{clock\_set\_time}} function computes when the system started
in seconds since the Epoch and saves the result in newly implemented {\it{boottime}} variable.



Unlike GIT!
This variable, counting uptime in seconds,
is particularly used by stimers in Contiki
and modifying it would lead to misbehaviour of stimer library
described in section~\ref{sec:contiki-timers}.


If the operating system implements the kernel discipline described in section~\ref{sec:system-discipline},
an NTP client will announce insertion and deletion of a leap second to the kernel and
the kernel will handle the leap second without further action necessary~\cite{ntp-faq}.
If the operating system does not implement the kernel discipline,
the system clock will show an error of one second after the leap second occurred~\cite{ntp-faq}.
The situation will be handled just like an unexpected change of time -
the operating system will continue with the wrong time for some time,
but an NTP client will step or adjust the time~\cite{ntp-faq}.
This will effectively cause the leap second correction to be applied too late.
% which is a trade-off for smaller memory requirements

Since there is no way of setting, getting and adjusting the time in Contiki OS,
a new interface for setting, getting and eventually
adjusting the time must be developed.
