\section{Contiki NTP client}
The NTP client application will use the designed operating system interface
from the previous sections and the uIP communication stack.


%DESIGN
%The broadcast mode is intended particularly for energy or memory constrained clients
%or for a huge number of NTP clients and a single NTP server
%in a network with small propagation delays.


!TO DESIGN!
%design---
Contiki NTP Client fills and checks only the seconds part of the NTP timestamp,
because the timestamp should be as accurate as possible and the
conversion from nanoseconds to NTP fraction part would increase the interval
between determination of the timestamp and dispatch of the packet.
