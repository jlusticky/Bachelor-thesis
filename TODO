Thesis
======
NTP - algorithms + history, Round Trip Time (RTT)
Kernel - events, process are protothreads, ...
Timers
Clock - figures
Use more BOOKs not only MISC in citations
Convert setup.txt and simulation.txt to latex + add photos
core/net/uip.h - The iIP packet buffer.

Tasks
=====
documentation for avr atmega1284p - 3timers and their usage
study clock interface on POSIX systems - FreeBSD paper <- citation
study clock hardware on x86 - hpet

Study ISR clock and timer interface on AVR

how to recognize that traffic belongs to this particular process

try NTP server - udp_new(NULL,... - port 123-123
read RFCs
implement
generate and read pdf docs
citation for embedded systems - one binary
contiki virtual - cooja
look to RS232 output in AVR Studio
