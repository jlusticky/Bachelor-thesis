Tasks
=====
citation for embedded systems - one binary

make new dir layout + more processes
----
measurement - graf + determine adjustments
----
DTS - Digital Time Service - rfc1305
adjust treshold - max we can adjust 32767*(1/128/32) with int16_t
---
equations, commas, grammar
---
implemente even from other process and try to display time on LCD
---
