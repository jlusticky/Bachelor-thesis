Thesis
======
NTP - algorithms + history, Round Trip Time (RTT)
Kernel - events
Timers
Clock - figures
Use more BOOKs not only MISC in citations
Convert setup.txt and simulation.txt to latex + add photos
core/net/uip.h - The uIP packet buffer.

describe ISR clock and timer interface on AVR

read RFCs
generate and read pdf docs
citation for embedded systems - one binary
contiki virtual - cooja
look to RS232 output in AVR Studio

dntpd - ntpreq.c

COOJA?

ipv4 - minimal-net platform and native

try new dir layout + more processes
document uip - app has to act on incomming data, overwrite
---
adjtime - wip
----
FAQ-kernel discipline
----
try broadcast - determine mode from incomming packet
