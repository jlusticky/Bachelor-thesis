Thesis
======
Clock - figures
Use more BOOKs not only MISC in citations
Convert setup.txt and simulation.txt to latex + add photos
-core/net/uip.h - The uIP packet buffer.

Tasks
=====
?documentation for avr atmega1284p - 3timers and their usage
study clock interface on POSIX systems - FreeBSD paper <- citation
?study clock hardware on x86 - hpet

describe ISR clock and timer interface on AVR

read RFCs
generate and read pdf docs
citation for embedded systems - one binary

dntpd - ntpreq.c

ipv4 - minimal-net platform and native

try new dir layout + more processes
document uip - app has to act on incomming data, overwrite
---
adjtime - wip
----
try broadcast - determine mode from incomming packet
thus, the time is always a monotonically increasing function.
----
text
measurement - graf + determine adjustments
another platform
compare my algo vs. real results
----
DTS - Digital Time Service - rfc1305
