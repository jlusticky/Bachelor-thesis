Tasks
=====
describe ISR clock and timer interface on AVR

read RFC - clock discipline
citation for embedded systems - one binary

dntpd - ntpreq.c

ipv4 - minimal-net platform and native

make new dir layout + more processes
----
measurement - graf + determine adjustments
----
DTS - Digital Time Service - rfc1305
adjust treshold - max we can adjust 32767*(1/128/32) with int16_t
---
equations, commas, grammar
---
test setup, debug + photos
---
reorganise and send for review
---
Operating systems targeted at embedded devices
TinyOS
...
---
try to sleep - if the time is automatically adjusted
implemente even from other process and try to display time on LCD
