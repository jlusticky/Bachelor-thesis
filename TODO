Tasks
=====
?documentation for avr atmega1284p - 3timers and their usage
?study clock hardware on x86 - hpet

describe ISR clock and timer interface on AVR

read RFCs
generate and read pdf docs
citation for embedded systems - one binary

dntpd - ntpreq.c

ipv4 - minimal-net platform and native

try new dir layout + more processes
document uip - app has to act on incomming data, overwrite
---
adjtime - wip
----
thus, the time is always a monotonically increasing function.
----
text
measurement - graf + determine adjustments
another platform
compare my algo vs. real results
----
DTS - Digital Time Service - rfc1305
adjust treshold - max we can adjust 32767*(1/128/32) with int16_t
----
uIP current supports broadcast packets as well as sending multicast packets. Joining multicast groups (IGMP) and receiving non-local multicast packets is not currently supported.
