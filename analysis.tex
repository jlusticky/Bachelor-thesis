\chapter{Analysis}
For keeping, measuring and resolving the time, computer needs a hardware clock.
A computer clock is an electronic device with a counter register counting oscillations in a
quartz crystal oscillator with a particular frequency~\cite{thesis-sync}.
Using the hardware clock, the operating system can keep and manipulate the system time.

Accessing the hardware clock is done through the operating system clock interface.
On top of the clock interface is an interface for providing the system time.
For implementation of a reasonably useful NTP client,
the operating system must be able to set, get and eventually adjust the system time
through the time interface.
Though not mandatory, adjusting the time is an important function,
if the time shall be always a monotonically increasing function.

Apart from that, an ability to communicate over UDP is also required for the NTP client.
This is a task of the operating system network interface.
Figure~\ref{fig:analysis-overview} shows the overview of NTP client components.

For developing and testing the Contiki NTP client,
the AVR Raven platform with 8-bit ATmega1284P CPU~\cite{avr-datasheet} will be used.
This platform features IEEE~802.15.4 (Low-Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks) link layer support.
Together with an adaptation layer called 6LoWPAN (IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks),
AVR Raven is able to communicate over IPv6.
