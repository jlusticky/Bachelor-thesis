\chapter{NTP client in Contiki OS}
For implementation of a reasonably useful NTP client
operating system must be able to set, get
and eventually adjust time.
Apart from that, ability of communicating over UDP is also required.

Thanks to uIP, described in section~\ref{sec:contiki-uip}, communication is
not a matter for Contiki OS.
Contiki is also able to use Domain Name System for IPv4 address resolution.
DNS resolution of IPv6 addresses was not implemented in Contiki OS
at the time of writing~\cite{contiki-docs}.
The main problem of NTP client implementation for Contiki is therefore total
lack of real-time support.
Not only no common interface availability but also
almost no platform-specific code has been implemented towards time support yet.
Contiki provides basic clock interface particularly for use of timers though.
This interface is common for all supported platforms,
but the particular implementation is platform specific.

Another deal is possible packet loss if communication uses UDP on transport layer.
The reason this can happen often is explained in section~\ref{sec:contiki-uip}.

For developing and testing Contiki NTP client the AVR Raven platform with ATmega1284P~\cite{avr-datasheet} was used.

How to get a working setup with Contiki on this platform is described in

\section{Hardware clock interface}
Contiki features a basic clock interface with a simple goal - measuring time.
This interface provides needed calls for timers and its definition is to be found in {\it{/core/sys/clock.h}} file.
Specific implementations of this common interface are located in {\it{/cpu}} directory of Contiki source code.
The interface provides call for initialising CPU's clock system - {\it{clock\_init}}, that is automatically called during
boot sequence of Contiki.
The goal of the {\it{clock\_init}} call is to set up
appropriate counter registers and interrupt service routines. %! TODO .. as described in chapter..
On AVR CPU this call is implemented as C macro which evaluates to specific setup code for each CPU
when compiling.
The setup code is not common to all CPUs because of differences among them - e.g. there are usually
only three Timer/Counter modules, but AVR ATmega1284P has four Timer/Counter modules~\cite{avr-datasheet}.

%At least one of those is always 16 bit wide
%This extra module on AVR ATmega1284P is used for
% three vs. 3

%clock\_seconds
%CLOCK\_SECOND
This is however enough for implementing a reasonable time interface and using it for NTP client later.

Adjusting time - COMPARE\_REGISTER = 31 => 128Hz => 1s = 1s
FREQ = 32768/8 / 32
COMPARE\_REGISTER = 30 => ca132.129Hz => 1s = ca1.032258s
FREQ = 32768/8 / 31
COMPARE\_REGISTER = 32 => 124.12per => 1s = 0.96p
FREQ = 32768/8 / 33

=> fastest adjust is 0,03s / s


Each TCNT2 increment is $\frac{1}{128 \times 32} \doteq 0,000244$ s
2,44ms minimum clock slew
This is also minimal possible clock adjustment.


Adjustments will influence the timers.
Applications requiring uninfluenced timers
are therefore advised to use rtimers, described in section~\ref{sec:contiki-timers},
because they use separate hardware clock
unaffected by NTP client.
