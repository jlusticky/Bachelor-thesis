\chapter{Implementation}
This chapter describes the implementation of the designed interface extension %!LYDIA
and the implementation of the designed NTP client application.
The following software was used for the development:
Ubuntu~10.10, GCC~4.3.5, Binutils~2.20.1, AVR Libc~1.6.8 and Contiki~2.5.
The AVR Dragon programmer and AVRDUDE~5.10
were used for flashing the AVR Raven hardware.

How to get a working setup with Contiki on the AVR Raven platform is described in
the documents on the CD enclosed to this thesis.
The table of CD contents is listed in appendix~\ref{app:cd-contents}.
