\chapter{NTP client in Contiki OS}

----analysis
The main problem of NTP client implementation for Contiki is therefore total
lack of real-time support.
Not only no common interface is available, but also
almost no platform-specific code has been implemented towards time support yet.
Contiki provides basic clock interface particularly for use of timers though.
This interface is common for all supported platforms,
but the particular implementation is platform specific.
----

%... This can be effectively solved by NTP Poll Interval.
