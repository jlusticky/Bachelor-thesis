\chapter{NTP client in Contiki OS}
%\!Distinguish between TIME and CLOCK

For implementation of a reasonably useful NTP client
operating system must meet conditions listed in appendix~\ref{app:requirements}.
The main problem for NTP client implementation in Contiki is a total
lack of time support.
Not only no common interface availability but also
almost no platform-specific code has been implemented towards time support yet.
Contiki provides basic clock interface particularly for use of timers though.
This interface is is common to for all supported platforms, but the particular implementation
is platform specific.

Another deal is possible packet loss if communication uses UDP on transport layer.
The reason while this can often happen is explained in section~\ref{sec:contiki-uip}.


\section{Time interface}
Clock interface with a simple goal - measuring time.
This is however enough for implementing a reasonable time interface and later using it for NTP client.

% ntp interface extending the clock library, similiar to posix calls
