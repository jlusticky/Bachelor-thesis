\chapter{NTP client in Contiki OS}
\!Distinguish between TIME and CLOCK

For implementation of a reasonably useful NTP client
operating system must meet conditions listed in appendix~\ref{app:requirements}.
The main problem for NTP client implementation in Contiki is a total
lack of time support.
Not only no common interface availability but also
almost no platform-specific code has been implemented towards time support yet.
Contiki provides basic clock interface particularly for use of timers though.
