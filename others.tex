\chapter{NTP on other systems} %+next chapter Contiki NTP client design
NTP daemon is an application running in user-space using kernel calls to set, get and
adjust system time.

The operating system is assumed to provide two
functions: one to set the time directly, for example, the Unix
settimeofday() function, and another to adjust the time in small
increments advancing or retarding the time by a designated amount,
for example, the Unix adjtime() function~\cite{rfc5905}.

The operating system interface is specified by POSIX standard on Unix-like operating systems~\cite{posix}.

%Older x86 processors used an interrupt mechanism to switch from
%user-space to kernel-space, but new x86 processors provide instructions
%that optimise this transition (using sysenter and sysexit instructions)~\cite{ibm-linux-system-calls}.
%... This is not in Contiki, as operating systems targeted at embbeded systems produce only 1 binary file. CITATION
