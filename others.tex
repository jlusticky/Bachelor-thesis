\chapter{NTP on other systems}
NTP daemon is an application running in user-space using kernel calls to set, get and
adjust system time.
The kernel interface is specified by POSIX standard on Unix-like operating systems~\cite{posix}.

%Older x86 processors used an interrupt mechanism to switch from
%user-space to kernel-space, but new x86 processors provide instructions
%that optimise this transition (using sysenter and sysexit instructions)~\cite{ibm-linux-system-calls}.
%... This is not in Contiki, as operating systems targeted at embbeded systems produce only 1 binary file. CITATION
