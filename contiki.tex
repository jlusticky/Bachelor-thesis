\chapter{Contiki OS}
Only 2\% of all microprocessors that are sold today are used in PCs and the remaining 98\%
of all microprocessors are used in embedded systems~\cite{thesis-programming}.
Embedded systems have much smaller amounts of memory than PC computers.
Moore's law predicts that these devices
can be made significantly smaller and less expensive in the future.
While this means that embedded system networks can
be deployed to greater extents, it does not necessarily imply
that the resources will be less constrained~\cite{paper-contiki}.
The memory constraints make programming for embedded systems a challenge.

Operating system Contiki is targeted at embedded systems supporting MSP430, AVR, ARM, x86
architectures and many others~\cite{contiki-docs}.
Contiki aims for maximum portability and therefore is written in C.
It is a feature-rich operating system and
only some of its features are described in this thesis.

Contiki is developed by a group of developers from industry and academia
lead by Adam Dunkels from the Swedish Institute of Computer Science.
The Contiki team currently consists of sixteen developers from SICS,
SAP AG, Cisco, Atmel, NewAE and TU Munich~\cite{contiki-docs}.
Contiki is also deployed at RheinMain University in Wiesbaden.
The 3-clause BSD license places minimal restrictions on redistribution of Contiki.
Version 1.0 of Contiki OS was released in 2002, version 2.0 in 2007 and the latest version
at the time of writing was 2.5 released in 2011.
The actual development happens in online repository accessible on Contiki homepage at \url{http://www.contiki-os.org/}
using Git version control system.
