\chapter{Contiki OS}
Only 2\% of all microprocessors that are sold today are used in PCs the remaining 98\%
of all microprocessors are used in embedded systems. The microprocessors
used in embedded systems have much smaller amounts of memory than PC computers.
The memory constraints make programming for embedded systems a challange \cite{thesis-programming}.

Operating system Contiki is targeted at embedded systems supporting MSP430, AVR, ARM, x86 architecture and many others.
Contiki aims for maximum portability and therefore is written in C. It features RFC compliant TCP/IP stack called uIP~(micro~IP)
providing communication abilities using both IPv4 and IPv6\cite{contiki-docs}. Contiki with its uIP stack is IPv6 Ready Phase 1 certified
and therefore has the right to use the IPv6~Ready silver logo~\cite{ipv6ready-db}. Before Contiki's uIP the embedded world considered IP to be too
heavyweight. That means all sonner available IP implementation were much bigger than the memory constrained embedded systems
could use. For more about uIP refer to section~\ref{sec:contiki-uip}.

Next to the uIP Contiki is equipped with other communication stack called Rime.
Rime is a layered communication stack for sensor networks,
with much tinner layers than traditional architectures.
Rime is designed to simplify the implementation of communication
protocols. \ref{sec:contiki-rime}

Protothreads are another new concept brought by Contiki to the embedded world.
Protothreads are very lightweight and compatible with ANSI C standard.
Each Protothread does not require a separate stack which makes them perfectly
fit for usage in programming memory constrained embedded systems.
Protothreads are more detailed discussed in section~\ref{sec:contiki-protothreads}.

Operating system Contiki, uIP and Protothreads are used by hundreds of companies in embedded devices in
such diverse systems as car engines, oil boring equipment, satellites, and con-
tainer security systems. The software is also used both in academic research
projects and in university project courses on embedded systems throughout the
world \cite{thesis-programming}.

Contiki is developed by a group of developers from industry and academia
lead by Adam Dunkels from the Swedish Institute of Computer Science.
The Contiki team currently consists of sixteen developers from SICS,
SAP AG, Cisco, Atmel, NewAE and TU Munich~\cite{contiki-docs}.
The 3-clause BSD license is placing minimal restrictions on how Contiki can be redistributed.
Contiki version 1.0 was released in 2002, version 2.0 in 2007 and the latest version at the time of writing was 2.5
released in 2011. The actual development happens in a repository online using the Git version control system.
